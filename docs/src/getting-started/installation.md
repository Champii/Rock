# Installation

Rock's release toolchain supports only Linux x86_64 with GNU glibc (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`). The binary baseline is Ubuntu 24.04, requiring glibc 2.39 or newer and a C linker available as `cc`. LLVM 18 is statically linked, so end users do not need to install LLVM. The executables are not fully static: system-library dependencies remain.

> **Release format:** rockup requires `v0.5.0` or later. Historical releases use a different asset layout and cannot be installed through this bootstrap.

## Prerequisites

For binary installation on Ubuntu 24.04, install the runtime requirements yourself:

```console
$ sudo apt install build-essential curl ca-certificates
```

GNU tar, gzip, and `sha256sum` must also be installed (normally already present on Ubuntu). Rockup uses curl for HTTPS downloads and those tools to verify and unpack archives. The installer never invokes `sudo` or installs operating-system packages. Neither Rust nor LLVM is required to use a binary release.

## Install a release

Install the manager and complete Rock toolchain with this one-liner. It executes a script from the official `Champii/Rock` release publisher; only run it if you trust that publisher. You can inspect [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/latest/download/install.sh) separately first.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' -fsSL https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The bootstrap downloads the standalone `rockup-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and its exact `.sha256` sidecar over HTTPS, checks that the sidecar names that asset and that its checksum matches, then executes `rockup self install`. This copies the manager and command shims and adds shell setup. The script then invokes the installed manager's `rockup install stable` automatically to download and install the compiler, project command, language server, and standard library. No shell restart or separate command is needed between these steps.

Rockup verifies the toolchain archive before unpacking it. Checksums detect corruption; they are not independent signatures, so you still trust the official release publisher and HTTPS.

The bootstrap defaults to `stable`, meaning GitHub's latest published non-prerelease release, not a promise that this experimental language has a stable API. To pin both the manager and toolchain versions when bootstrapping, pass a published `vVERSION` tag:

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' -fsSL https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh -s -- v0.5.1
```

That command installs both rockup and the `v0.5.1` toolchain. From a checkout, `sh scripts/install.sh v0.5.1` does the same. Stable manager assets come from `releases/latest/download`; pinned manager assets come from `releases/download/vVERSION`.

### Home and shell setup

The bootstrap persists rockup as `~/.rockup/bin/rockup`, creates `rock`, `rockc`, and `rock-lsp` shims in `~/.rockup/bin`, and installs the selected toolchain under `~/.rockup/toolchains`. Set `ROCKUP_HOME` to a nonempty absolute path before installation to use another location; keep using that value in later shells.

An installed toolchain uses the standard library beside its own binaries, even when you run it inside a compiler checkout with a `target/` directory. `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` affects development sysroot discovery, not installed toolchains. `ROCK_SYSROOT` remains an explicit override; leave it unset for normal rockup-managed use.

The bootstrap refuses to overwrite an existing `ROCKUP_HOME/bin/rockup`, including a dangling symlink. Use that installed manager's `install`, `update`, or `self update` command instead of rerunning the bootstrap. If toolchain installation fails after the manager is installed, the script exits with an error and prints the exact command to retry; the manager remains installed. Installing a release does not delete an installed local `dev` toolchain or replace an existing default; the first toolchain in an empty home becomes the default.

Rockup writes an `env` file and a managed activation block to `.bashrc` for Bash, `.zshrc` for Zsh, or `.profile` for other shells, based on `SHELL`. It also updates existing Bash and Zsh configuration files. Restart your shell, or activate a POSIX-compatible shell immediately:

```sh
. "${ROCKUP_HOME:-$HOME/.rockup}/env"
```

After activating the shell, verify:

```sh
rock --version
rock-lsp --help
```

The generated activation script uses POSIX shell syntax; it is not native Fish or PowerShell setup. `rock-lsp` without arguments starts an LSP server over standard input/output, not an interactive prompt.

## Manage releases and pins

With rockup installed, the shortest commands install or update the latest stable release:

```console
$ rockup install
$ rockup update
```

Both commands default to `stable`. Use `update` when that toolchain is already installed.

Install a version without changing an existing default:

```console
$ rockup install v0.5.1
```

The bare spelling `rockup install 0.5.1` selects the same release and stores it as `v0.5.1`; do not run both installation commands for the same version. To choose it globally or run a single command explicitly:

```console
$ rockup default v0.5.1
$ rockup run v0.5.1 rock --version
```

`rockup default NAME` selects an installed toolchain, including local `dev`, and automatically installs a missing stable or versioned release. Arbitrary local names must first be installed with `--path`.

For a project pin, create `rock-toolchain.toml` in the project directory with this schema:

```toml
[toolchain]
channel = "v0.5.1"
```

Install that version first. The shims select a toolchain using `ROCKUP_TOOLCHAIN` first, then the nearest `rock-toolchain.toml` in the current directory or its ancestors, then the global default. A project pin selects an installed toolchain; it does not automatically download one. Use the canonical `v` spelling for version pins, or an installed local name such as `dev`.

Update the moving stable toolchain and the manager separately:

```console
$ rockup update
$ rockup update stable
$ rockup self update
$ rockup list
```

The first two commands are equivalent. Updating `stable` leaves separately installed pinned versions and local development toolchains in place. `self update` replaces the running rockup executable with the latest stable manager. To remove a version, select a different default first and remove any project or environment selection that still refers to it:

```console
$ rockup default stable
$ rockup remove v0.5.1
```

Rockup is not a full Rustup replacement. Release downloads do not support Windows, macOS, musl, other CPU architectures, a nightly channel, or automatic cross-target installation. The local `target add --path` component workflow does not imply downloadable cross-target releases.

## Build from source

For compiler development or a local source build, install these additional tools through your operating system:

- Git
- A Rust toolchain with Cargo
- LLVM 18 development tools (including `llvm-config`), headers, and static archives
- A C linker available as `cc`

On Ubuntu 24.04, install the build dependencies and select LLVM 18 explicitly:

```console
$ sudo apt install llvm-18-dev libpolly-18-dev libzstd-dev libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libedit-dev libncurses-dev build-essential
$ export LLVM_SYS_180_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-18
```

Source builds require static LLVM archives; there is no dynamic-linking fallback.

Clone the repository and build the release toolchain:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Champii/Rock.git
$ cd Rock
$ cargo build --release
```

## Preparing a development toolchain

Package the standard library beside the release binaries, then install that directory as a local toolchain:

```console
$ target/release/rockup dev stdlib package \
    --path stdlib \
    --sysroot target/release
$ target/release/rockup install dev --path target/release
$ target/release/rockup default dev
```

The installer creates command shims and prints the shell setup it added. Restart the shell when prompted, then verify the user-facing command:

```console
$ rock --version
$ rock-lsp --help
$ rockup list
```

The selected toolchain contains the compiler implementation and matching standard library, but application authors interact with it through `rock`. The project command discovers manifests, builds path dependencies, selects the standard library, and manages output paths.

It also contains `rock-lsp`, the language server used by editors. `rockup` installs a shim for this command alongside `rock`, so an editor started from the activated shell can find the selected server. `rock-lsp --help` checks that the command can start; running it without arguments starts an LSP server over standard input and output, not an interactive compiler prompt.

## Optional editor setup

The repository includes a Neovim plugin that uses Neovim's built-in LSP client; it does not require `nvim-lspconfig`. The plugin requires Neovim 0.11 or newer. With Neovim 0.12, add this to `init.lua` to install it with the built-in package manager:

```lua
vim.pack.add({ "https://github.com/Champii/Rock" })
require("rock").setup()
```

Installing the plugin does not build or install the Rock toolchain. Complete the toolchain steps above first, then open a project's `.rk` file and run `:checkhealth rock`.

For local-checkout setup, editor commands, and a walkthrough of compiler errors, continue with [Editors and Diagnostics](editor-and-diagnostics.md). Other LSP clients can start `rock-lsp` for `.rk` files using the `rock` language identifier and standard input/output transport.

## Compiler contributor checks

Run the compiler's Rust tests when changing the language implementation:

```console
$ cargo test -p rock-lib
```

## Common setup failures

- HTTP 404 for bootstrap assets means the selected release does not provide the required assets; select `v0.5.0` or later, or use the source workflow.
- A checksum mismatch or malformed sidecar stops installation before the downloaded manager executes. Do not bypass verification; retry or report the release asset problem.
- `GLIBC_2.39` errors mean the host is older than the release baseline. Use Ubuntu 24.04 or a compatible newer GNU system, or build from source on your host.
- Source-build `llvm-config` or missing static-archive errors mean you should check the LLVM 18 development packages above and `LLVM_SYS_180_PREFIX=/usr/lib/llvm-18`; do not switch to dynamic linking. Binary releases do not require an LLVM installation.
- A missing standard-library component means the packaging step did not complete or the installed toolchain does not match the checkout.
- If `rock` is not found after installation, restart the shell or apply the activation command printed by `rockup`.
- If `rock-lsp` is missing from a toolchain built from an older checkout, rebuild and package the current workspace before installing it; a current toolchain installation requires the server binary too.
- If an editor cannot find `rock-lsp` but the shell can, start the editor from that shell or configure an absolute server command as shown in [Editors and Diagnostics](editor-and-diagnostics.md).
- If a generated executable is not found, inspect the project's `build/` directory.
