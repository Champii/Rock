# Rock 0.1.2

Little toy language made with Rust and LLVM.  
Aim to follow the Rust model with enforced safeness with a borrow checker and native performances thanks to LLVM.  
It's highly inspired from Livescript, and will borrow (pun intended) some features and syntaxes from Crystal, from functional languages like Haskell, or even from Rust itself.

## Features

- Strongly typed
- Parametric Polymorphism(Soon(tm))
- Type inference
- Custom operators
- Compile to LLVM IR

## Ongoing development

This project, its syntax and its APIs are subject to change at any moment. This is a personal project, please bear with me :)

## Quickstart and Example

Creating a new project folder

``` sh
mkdir -P new_project/src && cd new_project
```

Add some files like this:

`./src/std.rk`

``` haskell
infix + 4
+ a b = ~Add a b

infix * 5
* a b = ~Mul a b

infix |> 1
|> c h = h c
```

`./src/main.rk`

```haskell
mod std

use std::*
use std::+
use std::|>

f a = a + 2
g a = a * 2

main =
    if true
    then g (1 + 2) |> f 
    else 2
```

Assuming you built Rock and put its binary in your PATH:

``` sh
rock run
```

## Usage
