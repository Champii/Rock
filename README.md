# Rock v0.1.5-structs

[![Rust](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=structs)](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Little toy language made with Rust and LLVM.  
Aim to follow the Rust model with enforced safeness with a borrow checker and native performances thanks to LLVM.  
It's highly inspired from Livescript, and will borrow (pun intended) some features and syntaxes from Crystal, from functional languages like Haskell, or even from Rust itself.

## Development notes

This project, its syntax and its APIs are subject to change at any moment.  
This is a personal project, so please bear with me  
(Differently put: this is a big red hot pile of experimental garbage right now)

## Install

How to install and run the compiler:

### Using released binary

[Rock v0.1.5-structs](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/download/v0.1.5-structs/rock) (Tested on arch linux)

``` sh
wget https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/download/v0.1.5-structs/rock
chmod +x rock
./rock -V
```

### With cargo from git

``` sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Champii/Rock
rock -V
```

### From sources

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/Champii/Rock.git
cd Rock
cargo run -- -V
```

## Quickstart

Lets create a new project folder to compute some factorials

``` sh
mkdir -P factorial/src && cd factorial
```

Add some files like this:

- Copy the std lib files from [std](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/blob/master/std/src) into `./src/`

- Create a `./src/main.rk` file:

```haskell
mod lib

use lib::prelude::*

# Polymophic function
id a = a

fact a =
    if a <= 1
    then 1
    else a * fact (a - 1)

main = print fact id 4
```

Assuming that you built Rock and put its binary in your PATH:

``` sh
rock run
```

Should output

``` sh
24
```

## Showcases

### Custom infix operator

``` haskell
mod lib

use lib::prelude::*

infix |> 1
|> x f = f x

f a = a + 2

main = print (4 |> f)
```

``` sh
rock run
```

Prints `6\n`

### Trait definition

This `trait ToString` is redondant with the `trait Show` implemented in the lib, and serves as a demonstration only

``` haskell
mod lib

use lib::prelude::*

trait ToString a
  toString :: a -> String

impl ToString Int64
  toString x = show x

impl ToString Float64
  toString x = show x

main =
  print toString 33
  print toString 42.42

```

### Struct instance and Show implementation

``` haskell
mod lib

use lib::prelude::*

struct Player
  level :: Int64
  name :: String

impl Show Player
  show p = show p.name

main =
  let player = Player
    level: 42
    name: "MyName"

  print player
```

``` sh
rock run
```

Prints `MyName\n`
