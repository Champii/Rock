# Rock v0.2.4-spaced-dot

[![Rust](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=spaced_dot)](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Little language made with Rust and LLVM.

Aim to follow the enforced safeness of the Rust model with a borrow checker (Soonâ„¢) and achieve high native performances thanks to LLVM.  
Rock is highly inspired from [Livescript](https://livescript.net/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

No to be taken seriously (yet)

## Install

Warning: This project has only been tested on Linux x86_64.

How to install and run the compiler:

### Using Released Binary 

You will need `clang` somewhere in your $PATH

Linux x86_64 only

[Rock v0.2.4-spaced-dot](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/download/v0.2.4-spaced-dot/rock) (Tested on arch, btw)

``` sh
wget https://github.com/Champii/Rock/releases/download/v0.2.4-spaced-dot/rock
chmod +x rock
./rock -V
```

### From source

You will need `llvm-12.0.1` and `clang-12.0.1` somewhere in your $PATH

Rock has been tested against Rust stable v1.60.0 and nightly

[Adding Rust Nightly](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/wiki/Adding-Rust-Nightly)

#### With Cargo from Git

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/Champii/Rock --locked
rock -V
```

#### Manual Clone and Build from Git

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Champii/Rock.git rock
cd rock
cargo run --<release|debug> -- -V
```

Note: If you clone and build manually, make sure to add `/[...]/rock/target/<release|debug>/` to you `$PATH` so you can run it anywhere on your system.

## Quickstart

- Lets create a new project folder to compute some factorials

``` sh
mkdir -p factorial/src && cd factorial
```

- Create a `factorial/src/main.rk` file:

```haskell
fact a =
    if a <= 1
    then 1
    else a * fact (a - 1)

main = fact 4 .print!
```

Assuming that you built Rock and put its binary in your PATH:

``` sh
$ rock run
24
```

Take a look at `rock --help` for a quick tour of its flags and arguments

Note that you currently must be at the project root to run the compiler. (i.e. inside the `./factorial/` folder)

## Showcases

### Polymorphic function

``` haskell
id a = a

main =
  id 1 .print!
  id 2.2 .print!
  id "Test" .print!
```

Prints 

``` sh
$ rock run
1
2.2
Test
```

The `id` function here is polymorphic by default, as we don't make any constraint on the type that we should take or return.  
If we did something like this  
`id a = a + a`  
We would have constrained `a` to types that implement [`Num`](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/blob/master/std/src/num.rk)

Note that this example would still be valid, as `Int64`, `Float64` and `String` are all implementors of `Num`(*).  

The output would be:

``` sh
2
4.4
TestTest
```

(*) `String` is nowhere at its place here, and only implements `+` for string concatenation. This should change in the future with more traits like `Add` in rust

### Custom infix operator

``` haskell
infix |> 1
|> x f = f x

f a = a + 2

main = (4 |> f).print!
```

``` sh
$ rock run
6
```

You can create any operator that is made of any combination of one or more of `'+', '-', '/', '*', '|', '<', '>', '=', '!', '$', '@', '&'`  

Most of the commonly defined operators like `+`, `<=`, etc are already implemented by the [stdlib](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/tree/master/std) that is automaticaly compiled with every package.  
There is a `--nostd` option to allow you to use your own custom implementation. 

### Trait definition

This `trait ToString` is redondant with the `trait Show` implemented in the stdlib, and serves as a demonstration only

``` haskell
trait ToString a
  tostring :: a -> String

impl ToString Int64
  @tostring = @show!

impl ToString Float64
  @tostring = @show!

main =
  (33).tostring!.print!
  (42.42).tostring!.print!
```

``` sh
$ rock run
33
42.42
```

### Struct instance and methods 

``` haskell
struct Player
  level :: Int64
  name :: String

impl Player
  new level =
    Player
      level: level
      name: "Default"
  @getlevel = @level

main =
  Player::new 1 .getlevel!.print!
```

``` sh
$ rock run
1
```

### Show implementation

``` haskell
struct Player
  level :: Int64
  name :: String

impl Show Player
  @show = @name + "(" + @level.show! + ")"

impl Print Player
  @print = printl @show!

main =
  let player = Player
    level: 42
    name: "MyName"

  player.print!
```

``` sh
$ rock run
MyName(42)
```

Note that the `printl` method is defined in the stdlib as
```haskell
printl a = c_puts a.show!
```
with `c_puts` being the `libc` `puts`

### Modules and code separation

- `./myproj/src/foo.rk`

```haskell
bar a = a + 1
```

- `./myproj/src/main.rk`

```haskell
mod foo

use foo::bar

main = bar 1 .print!
```

```sh
$ rock run
2
```

Note that we could have skiped the
`use foo::bar`
if we wrote
`main = foo::bar 1 .print!` 

## REPL

Only supports basic expressions for now.
Very unstable, very work in progress.

Be warned that for a given session, the whole code is re-executed at each entry.  
This includes I/O of all sorts (Looking at you, open/read/write in loops)

Note that the REPL expects to be run from the project root, and expects some version of the stdlib
to be available in the `./src` folder

You can start a REPL session with 

``` sh
rock -r
# OR
rock --repl
```

``` sh
Rock: v0.2.4-spaced-dot

Type ':?' for help

> add a b = a + b
> let x = 30
30
> let y = 12
12
> add x, y
42
> :t add
add: (Int64 -> Int64 -> Int64)
> _
```

## Development notes

This project, its syntax and its APIs are subject to change at any moment.  
This is a personal project, so please bear with me

Differently put: this is a big red hot pile of experimental garbage right now
