# Rock 0.1.1

Little toy language made with Rust and LLVM.  
Aim to follow the Rust model with enforced safeness with a borrow checker and native performances thanks to LLVM.  
It's highly inspired from Livescript, and will borrow (pun intended) some features and syntaxes from Crystal, from functional languages like Haskell, or even from Rust itself.

## Features

- Strongly typed
- Parametric Polymorphism
- Type inference
- Custom operators
- Compile to LLVM IR

## Ongoing development

This project, its syntax and its APIs are subject to change at any moment. This is a personal project, please bear with me :)

## Example

```haskell
mod other_file

infix + 4
infix * 5
infix |> 1

f a = a + 2
g a = a * 2

+ a b = ~Add a b
* a b = ~Mul a b
|> c h = h c

main =
    if true
    then g (1 + 2) |> f 
    else 2
```

## Usage
