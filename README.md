# Rock 0.1.2

Little toy language made with Rust and LLVM.  
Aim to follow the Rust model with enforced safeness with a borrow checker and native performances thanks to LLVM.  
It's highly inspired from Livescript, and will borrow (pun intended) some features and syntaxes from Crystal, from functional languages like Haskell, or even from Rust itself.

## Features

- Strongly typed
- Type inference
- Custom operators
- Typeclass (Traits)
- Parametric Polymorphism(Soon(tm))
- Compile to LLVM IR

## Ongoing development

This project, its syntax and its APIs are subject to change at any moment. This is a personal project, please bear with me :)

## Quickstart and Example

Lets create a new project folder to compute factorial

``` sh
mkdir -P factorial/src && cd factorial
```

Add some files like this:

- Copy the lib from std: [lib.rk](https://github.com/Champii/Rock/blob/master/std/src/lib.rk) into `./src/std.rk`

- Create a `./src/main.rk` file:

```haskell
mod std

use std::-
use std::*
use std::<=
use std::print

fact a =
    if a <= 1
    then 1
    else a * fact (a - 1)

main = print fact 4
```

Assuming that you built Rock and put its binary in your PATH:

``` sh
rock run
```

## Usage

### General commands

```
#> cargo build
#> ./target/debug/rock -h
